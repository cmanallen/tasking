A free and open source Django task management system.

Overview
--------

Tasking was built with the sole purpose of minimizing management overhead and reducing barriers to team building.
Tasking's main goals include:
* Ability to claim and complete tasks.
	* Users should also be able to comment on tasks.
* Ability to assign tasks upwards, downwards, and horizontally based on clear, easy to manage permissions.
* Ability to form teams in order to solve mutual problems.
* Ability to create meaningful reports.
